 PDB file detected as an archive file: single PDB input file

 Archive file recognized: at least one PDB input file was found...

 Let's work on the input data of the Archive file:

 Homogenize the permissions of the input files/directories of the Archive file

 Check the presence of broken symbolic links in the Archive file:
 No broken symbolic link found

 Check the presence of hidden files/directories in the Archive file:
 No hidden file/directory found

 Check the presence of empty files/directories in the Archive file:
 No empty file/directory found

 Check the presence of input files with the '.txt' extension in the Archive file:
 No file found with the '.txt' extension

 Check the presence of the space character in the directories and filenames in the Archive file:
 No space character found in the directories/filenames

 Check the presence of special characters in the directory names in the Archive file:
 No special characters found in the directory names

 Check the presence of special characters in the 'pdb log out config user' input filenames in the Archive file:
 No special characters found in the '.pdb' filename(s)
 No special characters found in the '.log' filename(s)
 No special characters found in the '.out' filename(s)
 No special characters found in the '.config' filename(s)
 No special characters found in the '.user' filename(s)

 Check the presence of double extensions in the 'pdb log out config user' input filenames in the Archive file:
 No double '.pdb' extension found for the '.pdb' filename(s)
 No double '.log' extension found for the '.log' filename(s)
 No double '.out' extension found for the '.out' filename(s)
 No double '.config' extension found for the '.config' filename(s)
 No double '.user' extension found for the '.user' filename(s)

 Check the presence of the 'Project.config', 'System.config' and 'frcmod.user' files in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No 'Project.config' file found
 WARNING: No 'System.config' file found
 WARNING: No 'frcmod.user' file found

 Check the presence of the Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB input files in the Archive file:
 Single 'Mol_red1.pdb' input file found in the working directory

 Check the presence of the Mol_red'n'-'i'.log QM geometry optimization files in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No Mol_red'n'-'i'.log QM geometry optimization file found

 Check the presence of the Data-R.E.D.Server directory in the Archive file:
 WARNING: No Data-R.E.D.Server directory found

 The conformations in a PDB input file must have the same atom order
 The conformations in the QM files must have the same atom order
 The atom order in the PDB and QM files must be identical

 → PDB input file: ./Mol_red1.pdb
 Copy ./Mol_red1.pdb into ./Mol_red1.pdb-ArchiveFile
 Check the format and the ATOM, HETATM, MODEL, ENDMDL, TER & CONECT keywords of Mol_red1.pdb
 Modify this file according to the PDB file format, and set the LF Unix ending character
 The number of atoms of Mol_red1.pdb is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok
 Check the number of atoms for the 1 conformation(s) of Mol_red1.pdb
 Mol_red1.pdb - Conformation No = 1 - Atoms per conformation = 44
 • Check the Mol_red1.pdb PDB input file:
   Single Conformation: no Atom Order to compare; Check the Elements
 ◦  Elements & Atom order OK
 • Check the QM file(s):
   QM file = WARNING QM_file_not_found - Conf. no 1
   No atom comparison is done

 Check the total charge values in the Project.config and PDB input files:
 - Mol_red1.pdb: Case 0 0 - MTtChg1 0 MTtChg2 0 Sum 0 - Conf 1
 -- MTtChg1 and MTtChg2 are undef. - use implicite (i. e. no) value for the total charge

 List the PDB input file(s) found in the working directory:
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 ./Mol_red1.pdb
 1 Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB file(s) found in the working directory
 Check and/or correct the indexes of the atoms of Mol_red1.pdb
 1 consecutive Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB input file(s) found in the working directory

 The Mol_red'n'.pdb PDB file number & consecutive PDB input file number are identical:
   The Mol_red1.pdb file is the only PDB input file used in this job

 The number of atoms of the Mol_red1.pdb input file is below the defined threshold (250 atoms): ok

 Add keywords chosen by the user during the submission procedure or defined by the PBS script in the System.config file

 ANALYSIS OF THE 'System.config' FILE USED FOR THIS JOB:
 Default charge derivation procedure = RESP-A1
 Default option: OPT_Calc = ON - The geometry optimization step is carried out with default criteria
 Default option: Freq_Calc = OFF - The frequencies computation step is not requested
   (This step is useful to determine the nature of the stationary point found during the geometry optimization step)
 Default option: MEPCHR_Calc = ON - The MEP computation and charge derivation/force field generation steps are carried out
 Default option: Re_Fit = OFF - The re-generation of the force field from QM data is not requested

 The geometry optimization step is requested in the System.config file
 Correct PDB input file(s) found with compatible atom orders
 1 QM file(s) is/are missing
 Let's run PyRED as the QM file(s) is/are not demanded...

 CHECK FOR A PUTATIVE ATTACK OF THE CLUSTER:
 Text archive file dectected...
 Check input file './ArchiveFile.bin' for a putative attack
 Check input file './Mol_red1.pdb' for a putative attack
 Check input file './Mol_red1.pdb-ArchiveFile' for a putative attack
 Check input file './System.config' for a putative attack
 No potential attack detected...
